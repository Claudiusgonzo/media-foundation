# Adding a new tool
Add a section in this README.MD with:
- A quick overview of what the tool is and how to use it.
- Links to binaries for the tool.
- Link to the seperate repo containing the source for your tool.

# Tools
- **NotARealTool**: If I were a real tool I would have a quick description here.
